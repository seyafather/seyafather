Hi, I'm Seid, a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in PHP, SQL, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JS, jQuery, and prompt engineering.
I excel in API integration and am far from just a beginner programmer.
I lead a talented team and run my own website, ACS Education and Training.
My front-end skills shine in creating visually stunning and user-friendly interfaces,
and I’m also a branding expert who understands the importance of a strong visual identity.
On the backend, I prioritize security to ensure robust and reliable applications. 
Let’s collaborate and bring your vision to life!
